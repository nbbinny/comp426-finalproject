# comp426-finalproject
Final Project for Comp 426: Web Development

	30 points: Having a front end that is interactive and event-driven
	30 points: Having a back end that serves at least two resources with a RESTful CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) API.
	10 points: Uses at least one 3rd party API
	10 points: Uses session-persistent state in some way.
	For example, authenticating the user and then having user-specific preferences and/or data.
	10 points: A pleasing user experience (i.e., easy to use, good design, etc.).
	10 points: Quality of presentation video (see below)

    Each group will be expected to turn in their final projects as a repository with all of the code, stylesheets, images, and any other files developed as part of their project with a top-level README.md file that briefly describes their project and includes a link to a presentation video.

The presentation video should be no more than 10 minutes long and should demonstrate your final project and describe the various components of its implementation. You should think of this as if you are presenting your work to someone who may be interested in purchasing your software. To that end, you are trying to show that the web application you built is interesting, useful, and well-constructed. We will be primarily grading based on your presentation video, so be sure that it appropriately points out or otherwise demonstrates the various aspects listed above (i.e., interactive front-end, backend RESTful API, 3rd party APIs in use, session-persistent state, design elements, etc.).
